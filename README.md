## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to automate the process of organizing job folders on a network fileshare based on input from a schedule spreadsheet. The script `job_organizer.py` creates or modifies existing files within specified job folders. Future features will include a script that creates a material required list based on data provided from .kss files and imports it into a spreadsheet that can be manipulated after the fact.
